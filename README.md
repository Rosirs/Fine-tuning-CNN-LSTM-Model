# Fine-tuning-CNN-LSTM-Model for Gold Price Fluctuation Prediction
- dataset in the data director
- draw_cm.py is used to draw confusion matrix
- In the Fine_tuned_cnn_lstm_gold_price.ipynb, I removed models other than CNN-LSTM and I added dropout layer when type==3
- In the final.ipynb, I modified the data type, modified the time series to binary data format (0 or 1) and modified the model compilation to binary, adding the dropout layer
